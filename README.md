This mod adds a new machine, the Extractinator, which converts your throwaway blocks, such as gravel and cobblestone,
into valuable resources. It's based on Terraria's [Silt Extractinator](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Extractinator),
incorporating silt and slush ore, along with some
new features, such as full automation, support for additional blocks and extensive support for other mods.

## Developers

To add this library to your project, do the following:

```groovy
repositories {
  maven {
    // Location of the maven that hosts Alex's and Team Resourceful's files.
    name = "Team Resourceful Maven"
    url = "https://maven.resourcefulbees.com/repository/maven-public/"
  }
}
```

In an Architectury project, you would implement it like so:

Common

```groovy
dependencies {
    modImplementation "tech.alexnijjar.extractinator:extractinator-common-$rootProject.minecraft_version:$rootProject.extractinator_version"
}
```

Fabric

```groovy
dependencies {
    modImplementation "tech.alexnijjar.extractinator:extractinator-fabric-$rootProject.minecraft_version:$rootProject.extractinator_version"
}
```

Forge

```groovy
dependencies {
    modImplementation "tech.alexnijjar.extractinator:extractinator-forge-$rootProject.minecraft_version:$rootProject.extractinator_version"
}
