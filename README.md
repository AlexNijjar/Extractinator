# The Extractinator

This mod adds a new machine, the Extractinator, which converts your throwaway blocks, such as gravel and cobblestone,
into valuable resources. It's based on Terraria's [Silt Extractinator](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Extractinator),
incorporating silt and slush ore, along with some new features, such as full automation, support for additional blocks
and extensive support for other mods.

## Features

- Extractinator: Turns blocks into resources. It can even be automated with hoppers or item pipes.
- Silt and Slush: New blocks that spawn underground. Placing them in an extractinator yields valuable resources.
